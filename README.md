# NextJS-Wordpress-Headless-Hot-Dang-Homes

This project is divided into two different sections. The first, the more massive one, is devoted to Next Js, which I used as the front end of my project. Secondly we find the section dedicated to Wordpress which, in this case, is managed by the template-parts folder and the function.php file. Inserting all the Wordpress files was rather inconvenient so I thought I would integrate only the most important parts. To develop this project I used Local a rather fast and understandable Wordpress site management software. 
The site uses Headless technology to use Wordpress as a Backend allowing an eventual client to manage the site quickly and easily without necessarily touching any real code.
