# NextJS-Wordpress-Headless-Hot-Dang-Homes

# Project Overview

This project is structured into two main sections:

## 1. Next.js Frontend

The primary and more extensive section of this project is built using **Next.js**. Next.js serves as the frontend framework, leveraging its server-side rendering capabilities to deliver a robust user interface.

## 2. WordPress Backend

The secondary section involves **WordPress** which acts as the backend. This is managed primarily through:

- **Template-Parts Folder**: Contains modular parts of WordPress themes.
- **function.php File**: Functions file which plays a crucial role in the WordPress theme customization.

### Integration with Local

- **Local by Flywheel**: The development of this WordPress site was facilitated by Local, a user-friendly and efficient WordPress site management tool.

### Headless WordPress

- The project utilizes Headless technology to use WordPress as a backend. This setup allows an eventual client to manage the site content through WordPress without directly interacting with the source code, making content management straightforward and efficient.
